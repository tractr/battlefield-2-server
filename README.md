# bf2-docker

Dockerized Battlefield 2 server based on [insanity54/bf42-dock](https://github.com/insanity54/bf42-dock). The base image is `debian:stretch-slim` and was tested on Linux containers in Windows 10 WSL2 and Debian 11. Uses multi-stage builds to keep the image sizes down.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (optional)

## Usage

Different server variations are placed in the [images](https://github.com/tractr/battlefield-2-server/tree/master/images) folder. To create your own, you can copy one of the existing images to use as a base, and then place your custom files in the assets/bf2 folder to overwrite any existing files.

Initial settings or passwords can be set using environment variables. Persisted files like settings, logs and demos are put in the `/volume` directory in the container using symbolic links and should be mapped to a host directory. If you want to have full visibility of the server files you can also map the `/home/bf2/srv` folder of the container.

To use these images on a remote host like a VPS you can either use the snippets below to build and run or you can build the images locally and then push them to a container registry like Docker Hub or Azure Container Registry (public or private).

Running multiple servers on the same host can be done by changing the ports in the environment variables and the mapped host port. For this use case I prefer using Docker Compose, an example is listed further down.

### [default](https://github.com/tractr/battlefield-2-server/tree/master/images/default)

- Battlefield 2 server (1.5.3153.0)

The basic image to run a Battlefield 2 server. Not practical since you can't play online but it can be used as a base.

```
docker build -t tractr/battlefield-2-server:default ./images/default
docker run --name bf2server -p 4711:4711/tcp -p 4712:4712/tcp -p 16567:16567/udp -p 27901:27901/udp -p 29900:29900/udp tractr/battlefield-2-server:default
```

### [bf2hub-pb-mm](https://github.com/tractr/battlefield-2-server/tree/master/images/bf2hub-pb-mm)

- BF2Hub Unranked (R3)
- Updated PunkBuster
- ModManager (2.2c)
- Automatic demo hosting (nginx)

Uses BF2Hub to play online. The RCON password is set using environment variable `ENV_RCON_PASSWORD`. If you want to persist the demos on the host you can use `-v <host directory>:/var/www/html/demos` and use `-e ENV_DEMOS_URL='<host address>'` to provide demo urls after finished rounds.

```
docker build -t tractr/battlefield-2-server:bf2hub-pb-mm ./images/bf2hub-pb-mm
docker run --name bf2server -v <host directory>:/volume -e ENV_RCON_PASSWORD='rconpw123' -e ENV_DEMOS_URL='http://www.example.com:80/' -p 80:80/tcp -p 4711:4711/tcp -p 4712:4712/tcp -p 16567:16567/udp -p 27901:27901/udp -p 29900:29900/udp tractr/battlefield-2-server:bf2hub-pb-mm
```

### [bf2hub-pb-mm-bf2cc](https://github.com/tractr/battlefield-2-server/tree/master/images/bf2hub-pb-mm-bf2cc)

- BF2CC Daemon (1.4.2446)

Runs with bf2ccd.exe using Mono. The RCON and BF2CC Daemon passwords are set using environment variables `ENV_RCON_PASSWORD` and `ENV_BF2CCD_PASSWORD`.

```
docker build -t tractr/battlefield-2-server:bf2hub-pb-mm-bf2cc ./images/bf2hub-pb-mm-bf2cc
docker run --name bf2server -it -v <host directory>:/volume -e ENV_RCON_PASSWORD='rconpw123' -e ENV_BF2CCD_PASSWORD='bf2ccdpw123' -e ENV_DEMOS_URL='http://www.example.com:80/' -p 80:80/tcp -p 4711:4711/tcp -p 4712:4712/tcp -p 16567:16567/udp -p 27901:27901/udp -p 29900:29900/udp tractr/battlefield-2-server:bf2hub-pb-mm-bf2cc
```

### Docker Compose

To simplify setting up multiple servers on the same host you can use Docker Compose. The `image:` property can point to a locally built image or a URL to your container registry of choice. Note that the game server port and gamespy port need to match in the environment variables and in the Docker port configuration.

Here is an example of running two servers on the same host:

```yaml
version: "3.3"
services:
  bf2-docker-1-service:
    container_name: bf2-docker-1
    image: tractr/battlefield-2-server:bf2hub-pb-mm
    restart: on-failure
    environment:
      - ENV_SERVER_NAME=bf2-docker #1
      - ENV_MAX_PLAYERS=16
      - ENV_SERVER_PORT=16567
      - ENV_SERVER_INTERNET=0
      - ENV_SERVER_IP="0.0.0.0"
      - ENV_SERVER_MOTD="Welcome to bf2-docker"
      - ENV_GAMESPY_PORT=29900
      - ENV_DEMOS_URL=http://www.example.com:8000/
      - ENV_RCON_PASSWORD=rconpw123
    volumes:
      - "/data/bf2/bf2-docker-1/server:/home/bf2/srv"
      - "/data/bf2/bf2-docker-1/volume:/volume"
      - "./maplist.con:/home/bf2/srv/mods/bf2/settings/maplist.con"
    ports:
      - "8000:80/tcp"
      - "4711:4711/tcp"
      - "4712:4712/tcp"
      - "16567:16567/udp"
      - "27901:27901/udp"
      - "29900:29900/udp"

  bf2-docker-2-service:
    container_name: bf2-docker-2
    image: tractr/battlefield-2-server:bf2hub-pb-mm-bf2cc
    restart: on-failure
    environment:
      - ENV_SERVER_NAME=bf2-docker #2
      - ENV_MAX_PLAYERS=4
      - ENV_SERVER_PORT=16569
      - ENV_SERVER_INTERNET=0
      - ENV_SERVER_IP="0.0.0.0"
      - ENV_SERVER_MOTD="Welcome to bf2-docker"
      - ENV_GAMESPY_PORT=29901
      - ENV_DEMOS_URL=http://www.example.com:8001/
      - ENV_RCON_PASSWORD=rconpw123
      - ENV_BF2CCD_PASSWORD=bf2ccdpw123
    volumes:
      - "/data/bf2/bf2-docker-2/server:/home/bf2/srv"
      - "/data/bf2/bf2-docker-2/volume:/volume"
    ports:
      - "8001:80/tcp"
      - "4721:4711/tcp"
      - "4722:4712/tcp"
      - "16569:16569/udp"
      - "27911:27901/udp"
      - "29901:29901/udp"
```

Place the docker-compose.yml on the host and run `docker-compose up -d --remove-orphans` to create the containers. If you are not using a container registry then the images need to be built on the host first.

## Custom maps list

Override the default `maplist.con` with a custom one by mounting it to `/home/bf2/srv/mods/bf2/settings/maplist.con` in the container.

The default `maplist.con` is:

```text
mapList.append strike_at_karkand gpm_cq 32
```

## Development

First set up Docker Desktop on Windows (WSL2).

Download the assets (see assets.txt) and put them in the images/\*/assets/ folder so you don't need to redownload them on each build. Then make your changes in Dockerfile, build.sh, setup.sh and run.sh. Build and run with `.\build.bat`. Make sure Docker is set to use Linux containers.

Contributions to new or existing images are welcome if you want them public.

## Build the images

```shell
docker image build -t tractr/battlefield-2-server:latest ./images/default
docker image build -t tractr/battlefield-2-server:default ./images/default
docker image build -t tractr/battlefield-2-server:bf2hub-pb-mm ./images/bf2hub-pb-mm
docker image build -t tractr/battlefield-2-server:bf2hub-pb-mm-bf2cc ./images/bf2hub-pb-mm-bf2cc
docker image build -t tractr/battlefield-2-server:bf2hub-pb-mm-webadmin ./images/bf2hub-pb-mm-webadmin
```
